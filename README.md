# Flappy Bird Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using the **Pygame** library. Players control the bird and try to navigate through gaps in pipes without colliding.

---

## Features
- **Classic Gameplay:** Gravity, pipes, and ground collisions replicate the original Flappy Bird experience.
- **Custom Graphics:** Includes bird animations, pipes, background, and ground sprites.
- **Audio Effects:** Features sound effects for flapping and collisions.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game:** Run the script using Python.
2. **Controls:** Press the `Spacebar` or `Up Arrow` key to make the bird jump.
3. **Objective:** Navigate through the pipes and avoid collisions to achieve a high score.
